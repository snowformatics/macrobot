# About macrobot

Macrobot is an image analysis software for studying plant-pathogen interactions on macroscopic level. Currently the macrobot software can detect and quantify the following plant-pathogen interactions:
- Barley powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp hordei) on barely leaves 
- Wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici) on wheat leaves
- Wheat yellow rust (Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici) on wheat leaves
- Wheat brown rust  (Puccinia dispersa f. sp. tritici) on wheat leaves

The hardware system is based on a custom fully automated multispectral 2D imaging station (Figure 2).

Our image analysis pipeline is aimed to detect macroscopic disease symptoms for barley and wheat powdery mildew (Figure 3) as well as yellow and brown rust.
