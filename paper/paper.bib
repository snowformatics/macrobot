	abstract = {Plant diseases, as one of the perpetual problems in agriculture, is increasingly difficult to manage due to intensifying of the field production, global trafficking, reduction of genetic variability of crops, climatic changes-driven expansion of pests, redraw and loss of effectiveness of pesticides and rapid breakdown of the disease resistance in the field. The substantial progress in genomics of both plants and pathogens, achieved in the last decades has the potential to counteract this negative trend, however, only when the genomic data is supported by relevant phenotypic data that allows linking the genomic information to specific traits. In this respect, phenotyping is and will remain an essential element of any comprehensive functional genomics study.We have developed a set of methods and equipment and combined them into a {\textquotedblleft}Macrophenomics pipeline{\textquotedblright}. The pipeline has been optimized for the quantification of powdery mildew infection symptoms on wheat and barley but it can be adapted to other diseases and host plants. The Macrophenomics pipeline scores the visible disease symptoms, typically 5-7 days after inoculation (dai) in a highly automated manner. The system can precisely and reproducibly quantify the percentage of the infected leaf area with a throughput of the image acquisition module of up to 10 000 individual samples per day, making it appropriate for phenotyping of large germplasms collections and crossing populations.},

abstract = "Phenomics is an emerging transdiscipline dedicated to the systematic study of phenotypes on a genome-wide scale. New methods for high-throughput genotyping have changed the priority for biomedical research to phenotyping, but the human phenome is vast and its dimensionality remains unknown. Phenomics research strategies capable of linking genetic variation to public health concerns need to prioritize development of mechanistic frameworks that relate neural systems functioning to human behavior. New approaches to phenotype definition will benefit from crossing neuropsychiatric syndromal boundaries, and defining phenotypic features across multiple levels of expression from proteome to syndrome. The demand for high throughput phenotyping may stimulate a migration from conventional laboratory to web-based assessment of behavior, and this offers the promise of dynamic phenotyping—the iterative refinement of phenotype assays based on prior genotype-phenotype associations. Phenotypes that can be studied across species may provide greatest traction, particularly given rapid development in transgenic modeling. Phenomics research demands vertically integrated research teams, novel analytic strategies and informatics infrastructure to help manage complexity. The Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics at UCLA has been supported by the National Institutes of Health Roadmap Initiative to illustrate these principles, and is developing applications that may help investigators assemble, visualize, and ultimately test multi-level phenomics hypotheses. As the transdiscipline of phenomics matures, and work is extended to large-scale international collaborations, there is promise that systematic new knowledge bases will help fulfill the promise of personalized medicine and the rational diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes."

abstract = {Exogenous ATP produces acute and localized pain in humans, and P2X receptor agonists elicit acute nociceptive behaviours in rodents following intradermal administration to the hindpaw. The predominant localization of P2X3 mRNA in sensory neurones has led to the hypothesis that activation of P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 receptors contributes to nociception. The local administration of the P2X receptor agonist, BzATP (100 – 1000 nmol paw−1, s.c.) into the rat hindpaw produced an acute (<15 min) paw flinching response that was similar to that observed in the acute phase of the formalin (5\%) test. The co-administration of the potent P2X receptor antagonist, TNP-ATP (30 – 300 nmol paw−1), but not an inactive analogue, TNP-AMP, with BzATP into the rat hindpaw attenuated BzATP-induced nociception. Similarly, co-administration of TNP-ATP, but not TNP-AMP, with 5\% formalin reduced both acute and persistent nociception in this test. Co-administration of cibacron blue (30 and 100 nmol paw−1), a selective allosteric enhancer of P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptor activation, with BzATP (30 and 100 nmol paw−1) into the rat hindpaw produced significantly greater nociception as compared to the algogenic effects of BzATP alone. Intradermal co-administration of cibacron blue (30 and 100 nmol paw−1) with formalin (1 and 2.5\%) into the rat hindpaw also produced significantly greater nociceptive behaviour as compared to formalin alone. The ability of TNP-ATP and cibacron blue to respectively attenuate and enhance nociceptive responses elicited by exogenous BzATP and formalin provide further support for the hypothesis that activation of peripheral P2X3 containing channels contributes specifically to both acute and persistent nociception in the rat.
