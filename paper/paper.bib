	abstract = {Plant diseases, as one of the perpetual problems in agriculture, is increasingly difficult to manage due to intensifying of the field production, global trafficking, reduction of genetic variability of crops, climatic changes-driven expansion of pests, redraw and loss of effectiveness of pesticides and rapid breakdown of the disease resistance in the field. The substantial progress in genomics of both plants and pathogens, achieved in the last decades has the potential to counteract this negative trend, however, only when the genomic data is supported by relevant phenotypic data that allows linking the genomic information to specific traits. In this respect, phenotyping is and will remain an essential element of any comprehensive functional genomics study.We have developed a set of methods and equipment and combined them into a {\textquotedblleft}Macrophenomics pipeline{\textquotedblright}. The pipeline has been optimized for the quantification of powdery mildew infection symptoms on wheat and barley but it can be adapted to other diseases and host plants. The Macrophenomics pipeline scores the visible disease symptoms, typically 5-7 days after inoculation (dai) in a highly automated manner. The system can precisely and reproducibly quantify the percentage of the infected leaf area with a throughput of the image acquisition module of up to 10 000 individual samples per day, making it appropriate for phenotyping of large germplasms collections and crossing populations.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The aim of this review was to survey all fungal pathologists with an association with the journal Molecular Plant Pathology and ask them to nominate which fungal pathogens they would place in a ‘Top 10’ based on scientific/economic importance. The survey generated 495 votes from the international community, and resulted in the generation of a Top 10 fungal plant pathogen list for Molecular Plant Pathology. The Top 10 list includes, in rank order, (1) Magnaporthe oryzae; (2) Botrytis cinerea; (3) Puccinia spp.; (4) Fusarium graminearum; (5) Fusarium oxysporum; (6) Blumeria graminis; (7) Mycosphaerella graminicola; (8) Colletotrichum spp.; (9) Ustilago maydis; (10) Melampsora lini, with honourable mentions for fungi just missing out on the Top 10, including Phakopsora pachyrhizi and Rhizoctonia solani. This article presents a short resumé of each fungus in the Top 10 list and its importance, with the intent of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant mycology community, as well as laying down a bench-mark. It will be interesting to see in future years how perceptions change and what fungi will comprise any future Top 10.},

abstract = "We investigate empirically the role of moral and social concerns in farmers' decision to adopt integrated crop protection (IP) and organic farming (OF). A survey questionnaire has been sent to 1286 fruit-growers and vegetable producers located in the French areas of Alpes de Haute Provence, Hautes-Alpes and Vaucluse. Analysis of individual responses (N=243) shows that, although economic concerns play a strong role, a significant number of respondents give high importance to moral and social ones. We also examine how these considerations matter according to different crop protection strategies, that is, conventional farming, IP and OF. Using a multinomial logistic regression, we find that (1) social concerns (e.g., showing to others one's environmental commitment) drive both IP and OF adoption, (2) moral concerns (e.g., do not feel guilty about one's choices) increase the probability of organic farming adoption only, and (3) farmers who give high importance to economic concerns (e.g., cutting production costs) are less likely to adopt OF."

    abstract = { The emerging picture of plant and animal domestication and agricultural origins in the Near East is dramatically different from that drawn 16 years ago in a landmark article by Bar-Yosef and Meadow. While in 1995 there appeared to have been at least a 1,500-year gap between plant and animal domestication, it now seems that both occurred at roughly the same time, with initial management of morphologically wild future plant and animal domesticates reaching back to at least 11,500 cal BP, if not earlier. A focus on the southern Levant as the core area for crop domestication and diffusion has been replaced by a more pluralistic view that sees domestication of various crops and livestock occurring, sometimes multiple times in the same species, across the entire region. Morphological change can no longer be held to be a leading-edge indicator of domestication. Instead, it appears that a long period of increasingly intensive human management preceded the manifestation of archaeologically detectable morphological change in managed crops and livestock. Agriculture in the Near East arose in the context of broad-based systematic human efforts at modifying local environments and biotic communities to encourage plant and animal resources of economic interest. This process took place across the entire Fertile Crescent during a period of dramatic post-Pleistocene climate and environmental change with considerable regional variation in the scope and intensity of these activities as well as in the range of resources being manipulated. }

abstract = "Phenomics is an emerging transdiscipline dedicated to the systematic study of phenotypes on a genome-wide scale. New methods for high-throughput genotyping have changed the priority for biomedical research to phenotyping, but the human phenome is vast and its dimensionality remains unknown. Phenomics research strategies capable of linking genetic variation to public health concerns need to prioritize development of mechanistic frameworks that relate neural systems functioning to human behavior. New approaches to phenotype definition will benefit from crossing neuropsychiatric syndromal boundaries, and defining phenotypic features across multiple levels of expression from proteome to syndrome. The demand for high throughput phenotyping may stimulate a migration from conventional laboratory to web-based assessment of behavior, and this offers the promise of dynamic phenotyping—the iterative refinement of phenotype assays based on prior genotype-phenotype associations. Phenotypes that can be studied across species may provide greatest traction, particularly given rapid development in transgenic modeling. Phenomics research demands vertically integrated research teams, novel analytic strategies and informatics infrastructure to help manage complexity. The Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics at UCLA has been supported by the National Institutes of Health Roadmap Initiative to illustrate these principles, and is developing applications that may help investigators assemble, visualize, and ultimately test multi-level phenomics hypotheses. As the transdiscipline of phenomics matures, and work is extended to large-scale international collaborations, there is promise that systematic new knowledge bases will help fulfill the promise of personalized medicine and the rational diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes."

abstract = {Exogenous ATP produces acute and localized pain in humans, and P2X receptor agonists elicit acute nociceptive behaviours in rodents following intradermal administration to the hindpaw. The predominant localization of P2X3 mRNA in sensory neurones has led to the hypothesis that activation of P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 receptors contributes to nociception. The local administration of the P2X receptor agonist, BzATP (100 – 1000 nmol paw−1, s.c.) into the rat hindpaw produced an acute (<15 min) paw flinching response that was similar to that observed in the acute phase of the formalin (5\%) test. The co-administration of the potent P2X receptor antagonist, TNP-ATP (30 – 300 nmol paw−1), but not an inactive analogue, TNP-AMP, with BzATP into the rat hindpaw attenuated BzATP-induced nociception. Similarly, co-administration of TNP-ATP, but not TNP-AMP, with 5\% formalin reduced both acute and persistent nociception in this test. Co-administration of cibacron blue (30 and 100 nmol paw−1), a selective allosteric enhancer of P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptor activation, with BzATP (30 and 100 nmol paw−1) into the rat hindpaw produced significantly greater nociception as compared to the algogenic effects of BzATP alone. Intradermal co-administration of cibacron blue (30 and 100 nmol paw−1) with formalin (1 and 2.5\%) into the rat hindpaw also produced significantly greater nociceptive behaviour as compared to formalin alone. The ability of TNP-ATP and cibacron blue to respectively attenuate and enhance nociceptive responses elicited by exogenous BzATP and formalin provide further support for the hypothesis that activation of peripheral P2X3 containing channels contributes specifically to both acute and persistent nociception in the rat.
